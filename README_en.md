# theSource College App Community

- A community effort to popularize do-it-yourself college applications for (future) overseas students and to make the process more affordable.

> The Source of the Name
>
> The name of the project is borrowed from a term used in software development, "open source", which means that things are planned to be publicly accessible, so people can modify and share them.
> We hope to open source the experience and data of study abroad applications that were previously privatized by various corporations, and help more people complete the college application process at a lower cost.
> At the same time, we also want to be a source of power for individual applicants.
